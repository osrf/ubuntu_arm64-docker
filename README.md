Script (derived from https://github.com/djmaze/armhf-ubuntu-docker) to generate Ubuntu ARM64 Docker images.

The generated Docker images are available via [DockerHub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/osrf/ubuntu_arm64/).


Before you run this make sure to install the QEMU from linaro-overlay to get version 2.2 or higher.
